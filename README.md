# Classification of Dogs
Hey, What Kind of Dog is That?

Technology Utilized: Python | Pandas | Numpy | Matplotlib | SQL | Seaborn | Keras/Tensorflow | AWS Sagemaker | Google CoLabs | Scikit Learn

Utilized the Stanford Dog dataset to train a CNN multi-classification model with 1670 images in 10 classes. This project leveraged transfer learning for customized VGG-16 and VGG-19 models which classified the 10 classes of dogs with accuracy, avg. precision and avg. recall of 79.5 - 81.3, 78.8-80.5, 78.7-81.3%, for the VGG-16 and 19 models, respectively.
